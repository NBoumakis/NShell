This is a shell created by Nikos Boumakis at CSD.
Creation date: approx. 8/11/2021

It consists of 4 modules.
    Module "parser" (files "parser.h" and "parser.c") implements a parsing system for the shell.
    Module "parserUtilities" (files "parserUtilities.h" and "parserUtilities.c") implements several helper functions for the parser.
    Module "shell" (files "shell.h" and "shell.c") implements the actual shell, providing functions for prompting and command execution.
    Module "main" (file "main.c") implements the main working function of the shell.

Each function deliberately has a long name, so as to allow it to be descriptive of its results

Limitations:
    Currently no error checking is done, due to the deadline of the assignment.
    Also, there is support for pipelining but it is disabled due to it causing the shell to crash (gracefully). You could try uncommenting the relevant section in shell.c:execute().
    
    All limmitations will be fixed eventually.
